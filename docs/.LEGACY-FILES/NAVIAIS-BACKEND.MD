## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment Implementation

### Date: Current Date

### Implemented Components:

#### Testing Implementation

- **Unit Tests**
  - Created Jest configuration in `jest.config.js`
  - Set up Jest type definitions and environment in `jest.setup.js` and `setupTests.ts`
  - Implemented unit tests for utility functions in `src/utils/__tests__/effectsHelper.test.ts`
  - Created component tests for `TerminalManager` in `src/components/Terminal/__tests__/TerminalManager.test.tsx`
  - Added browser compatibility tests in `src/utils/__tests__/browserCompatibility.test.ts`
  - Implemented accessibility tests using jest-axe in `src/components/Terminal/__tests__/accessibility.test.tsx`

#### Deployment Implementation

- **Docker Configuration**

  - Created multi-stage `Dockerfile` for optimized container builds
  - Added `docker-compose.yml` for container orchestration
  - Included container documentation in `DEPLOYMENT.md`

- **CI/CD Pipeline**

  - Implemented GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
  - Set up automated testing, building, and deployment process
  - Added documentation for CI/CD configuration

- **Deployment Documentation**
  - Created comprehensive deployment guide in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
  - Documented deployment options for various platforms
  - Added troubleshooting section for common deployment issues

### Integration Notes:

- The testing setup includes both unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality
- The deployment configuration supports multiple hosting environments
- CI/CD pipeline automates the testing and deployment process
- Browser compatibility tests ensure the application works across different browsers

### Future Enhancements:

- Add end-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright
- Implement performance testing with Lighthouse CI
- Add load testing for backend services if needed
- Enhance Docker configuration with health checks and monitoring

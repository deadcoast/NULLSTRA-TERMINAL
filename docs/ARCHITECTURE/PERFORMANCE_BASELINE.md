## Component Performance

| Component       | Render Time | Description                               |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Terminal        | 28ms        | Main terminal component                   |
| MessageRenderer | 15ms        | Component for rendering terminal messages |
| TerminalInput   | 8ms         | Input component                           |
| CRTEffect       | 12ms        | Visual CRT effect overlay                 |
| TerminalWindow  | 35ms        | Overall terminal window container         |

## Bundle Analysis

| Bundle     | Size  | % of Total | Description             |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| main       | 450KB | 45.9%      | Main application bundle |
| vendor     | 380KB | 38.8%      | Third-party libraries   |
| components | 75KB  | 7.7%       | Shared components       |
| effects    | 45KB  | 4.6%       | Visual effects          |
| other      | 30KB  | 3.1%       | Miscellaneous code      |

## Server Performance

| Operation         | Time  | Description                             |
| ----------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| API Response      | 120ms | Average API endpoint response time      |
| Command Execution | 85ms  | Time to execute a command on the server |
| Socket.IO Latency | 45ms  | Round-trip time for socket messages     |
| Average CPU Usage | 15%   | Typical server CPU usage                |
| Average Memory    | 125MB | Typical server memory usage             |

## Identified Bottlenecks

1. **Text Rendering**: Complex text processing for terminal output
2. **Visual Effects**: CRT and other visual effects add rendering overhead
3. **Initial Load Time**: Bundle size impacts initial loading
4. **Socket.IO Communication**: Command response time affected by socket latency
5. **State Management**: Unnecessary re-renders during state updates

## Improvement Targets

| Metric                 | Current | Target | Improvement |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Initial Load Time      | 1.5s    | <1s    | 33%         |
| Bundle Size            | 980KB   | <700KB | 29%         |
| Terminal Render Time   | 35ms    | <20ms  | 43%         |
| Input Latency          | 40ms    | <25ms  | 38%         |
| Memory Usage           | 85MB    | <60MB  | 29%         |
| CRT Effect Performance | 12ms    | <8ms   | 33%         |

## Next Steps

Based on this baseline assessment, we should focus on:

1. **Bundle Optimization**: Further reduce bundle size through code splitting
2. **Text Rendering**: Optimize text processing and box-drawing functions
3. **State Management**: Implement context selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
4. **Server-Side Optimization**: Optimize command execution and response times
5. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verify performance across different browsers

## Measurement Methodology

This baseline was established using:

- Chrome DevTools Performance panel
- Lighthouse audits
- Web Vitals measurements
- Custom performance tracking via usePerformanceTracking hook
- Memory profiling with memoryProfiler utility
- Bundle analysis with webpack-bundle-analyzer

_Note: All measurements represent averages from 5 test runs on a standard developer machine (MacBook Pro, 2023, M2). Production performance may vary._

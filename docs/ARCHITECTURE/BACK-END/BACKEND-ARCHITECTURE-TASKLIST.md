    - Created frontend hook for Socket.io communication

- [ ] **Phase 2: Visual Enhancements & Effects**

  - [ ] **Integrate Visual Libraries**
    - [ ] Integrate particles.js (or similar) for background particle effects.
    - [ ] Integrate glitch-canvas (or similar) for glitch effects.
    - [ ] Integrate AOS (or similar) for scroll-triggered animations.
    - [ ] Explore and implement SVG Filters for noise/distortion.
  - [ ] **Apply Effects**
    - [ ] Apply background effects to `TerminalContainer`.
    - [ ] Apply glitch effects selectively (e.g., on specific events or text).
    * [ ] Apply scroll animations to terminal output or sections.

- [ ] **Phase 3: User Experience Features**

  - [ ] **Keyboard & History**
    - [ ] Integrate Mousetrap.js or Hotkeys.js.
    - [ ] Implement defined keyboard shortcuts.
    - [ ] Ensure robust command history navigation (Up/Down arrows).
  - [ ] **Command Assistance**
    - [ ] Implement Command Autocomplete (Tab completion).
    - [ ] Implement Context-sensitive Help system.
  - [ ] **UI Interactivity**
    - [ ] Implement Draggable Terminal Windows (if applicable).
    - [ ] Implement Minimizable/Maximizable Sections (if applicable).
    - [ ] Implement Custom Terminal Themes selection mechanism.
  - [ ] **Sound Effects (Optional)**
    - [ ] Integrate Howler.js or Tone.js.
    - [ ] Add sound effects for key events (command execution, errors, notifications).

- [ ] **Phase 4: Refactoring, Optimization & Accessibility**

  - [ ] **Code Quality & Refactoring**
    - [ ] Create `index.ts` barrel files for `/components`, `/components/UI`, `/hooks`, `/utils`.
    - [ ] Refactor imports across the project to use barrel files.
    - [ ] Review and refactor any identified code duplication.
  - [ ] **Performance Optimization**
    - [ ] Implement animations using `requestAnimationFrame`.
    - [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for `TerminalOutput`.
    - [ ] Implement lazy loading for heavy components or visual effects.
    - [ ] Explore Web Workers for intensive client-side processing (if any).
    - [ ] Configure Webpack/Next.js for code splitting.
    - [ ] Optimize Three.js rendering (if used).
  - [ ] **Accessibility**
    - [ ] Ensure full keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.
    - [ ] Add appropriate ARIA labels and roles.
    - [ ] Implement an optional high-contrast mode theme.
    - [ ] Test with screen readers.
    - [ ] Implement an option to reduce or disable motion effects.
  - [ ] **Responsiveness**
    - [ ] Implement adaptive layout adjustments for different screen sizes.
    - [ ] Design and implement simplified Mobile View.
    - [ ] Ensure Tablet/Desktop views provide the full experience.

- [x] **Phase 5: Testing & Deployment**
  - [x] **Testing**
    - [x] Write unit tests for utility functions and hooks.
    - [x] Write integration tests for core components and command processing.
    - [x] Perform manual cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
    - [x] Perform accessibility testing.
    - [x] Perform responsive design testing.
  - [x] **Deployment**
    - [x] Set up build process for production.
    - [x] Configure deployment environment (hosting, database, etc.).
    - [x] Deploy application.

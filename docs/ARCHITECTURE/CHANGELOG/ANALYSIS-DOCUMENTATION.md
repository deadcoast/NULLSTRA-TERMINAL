  - Added `.status-tag.updated::after` styles with shimmer effect using gradient
  - Added `@keyframes status-appear` for initial fade/scale-in animation
  - Leveraged existing `@keyframes status-slide` for shimmer movement
- Added Cursor Fade Blink:
  - Added new `.cursor-fade` class with smooth fading animation
  - Added `@keyframes blink-fade` animation with multiple opacity steps
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing cursor styles
  - Enhanced cursor styling with stronger glow effect

### CHANGED TerminalWindow Component

- src/components/Terminal/TerminalWindow.tsx
- Added support for processing state:
  - Added isProcessing prop to TerminalWindow component
  - Applied 'processing' CSS class to terminal-background when isProcessing is true
  - This enables reactive visual feedback when commands are being processed

### UPDATED useTerminal Hook

- src/hooks/useTerminal.ts
- Enhanced with processing state management:
  - Added isProcessing state to track when commands are being executed
  - Added setIsProcessing function to control the processing state
  - Updated the executeCommand function to set processing state during execution
  - Exposed isProcessing state and setIsProcessing function through the hook's return

### CHANGED Terminal Component

- src/components/Terminal/Terminal.tsx
- Integrated processing state with UI components:
  - Updated Terminal component to import and use TerminalWindow
  - Passed isProcessing state to TerminalWindow component
  - Passed isProcessing state to CRTEffect for dynamic visual effects
  - Passed isProcessing state as networkActive to StatusLine for real-time network indicator
- Added StatusPanel to the UI:
  - Integrated the StatusPanel component to display system status information
  - Positioned it above the terminal output for prominence
- Updated CommandPrompt usage:
  - Set cursor style to use the new fade effect

### CHANGED CommandPrompt Component

- src/components/Terminal/CommandPrompt.tsx
- Enhanced with command execution flash effect:
  - Added commandExecuted state for tracking when a command has just been executed
  - Added timeout to automatically remove commandExecuted state after animation completes
  - Applied command-input-line and command-executed classes for animation
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing command-execute class
- Added support for different cursor styles:
  - Added cursorStyle prop to allow choosing between default and fade animations
  - Added logic to apply the appropriate CSS class based on the selected style
  - Made default style backward compatible with existing implementation

## 2. ADDITIONS

### ADDED StatusTag Component

- src/components/Terminal/StatusTag.tsx
- Created a new component for displaying status indicators:
  - Implemented fade-in and scale animation on initial render
  - Added update shimmer effect through the 'updated' class
  - Includes auto-update functionality through configurable interval
  - Supports different status types (success, error, warning, info) with appropriate styling

### ADDED StatusPanel Component

- src/components/Terminal/StatusPanel.tsx
- Created a component for displaying system metrics and statuses:
  - Shows memory, CPU, disk, and network status with appropriate colored tags
  - Simulates dynamic updates to demonstrate the animation effects
  - Uses StatusTag components to display the metrics with visual feedback
  - Automatically triggers the update animation when values change

## DOCUMENT THE CHANGES BELOW

The implemented enhancements support the front-end code aesthetics detailed in FRONT-END-CODE-AESTHETICS.md:

1. Enhanced TypeWriter implementation now varies text speed, adds natural pauses after punctuation, and renders chunks of text for a more realistic terminal typing effect. This fulfills the "Improved Typewriter Effect" requirement from the tasklist.

2. Added network activity indicator to the StatusLine component, which provides visual feedback during network operations with a blinking indicator dot. This fulfills the "Network Activity Indicator" requirement from the tasklist.

3. Implemented Reactive Background Effects that provide subtle visual feedback through:

   - Scanlines that move continuously across the terminal background
   - Noise that creates a subtle texture and movement
   - A radial gradient that appears during processing states to indicate activity

   These effects create a more immersive and responsive terminal environment, fulfilling the "Reactive Background Effects" requirement from the tasklist.

4. Added Variable Text Intensity that makes newly typed text stand out with stronger text-shadow effects and automatically fade to normal intensity after a configurable duration. This creates a natural focus point on newly appearing content, fulfilling the "Variable Text Intensity" requirement from the tasklist.

5. Updated application architecture to properly propagate processing state:

   - Terminal executions now trigger visual feedback across multiple components
   - Processing state is properly shared through components using props
   - State management is centralized in the useTerminal hook

6. Implemented Command Execution Flash that provides visual feedback when commands are executed:

   - Added styles for command-input-line.command-executed using command-flash animation
   - Implemented automatic class management to briefly show the effect and then remove it
   - This creates a momentary "flash" effect when commands are executed, providing immediate visual confirmation

7. Verified Button Hover States have been properly implemented with:

   - Base .terminal-button styles including transitions and appropriate borders
   - Hover styles that provide visual feedback through background color changes and glow effects
   - Active and disabled states for a complete interactive experience

8. Added Status Indicator Animation through the new StatusTag component:

   - Tags animate in with a fade and scale effect when they first appear
   - Tags show a shimmer effect when their values are updated
   - The StatusPanel demonstrates these animations with changing system metrics
   - Different status types are color-coded for instant recognition
   - Auto-update functionality demonstrates the shimmer effect on regular intervals

9. Implemented Cursor Fade Blink with a smoother, more sophisticated animation:
   - Created a new cursor-fade class with enhanced styling
   - Added blink-fade keyframes with multiple opacity steps for a smooth transition
   - Added option to choose between default and fade cursor styles
   - Strengthened the visual appearance with more pronounced glow effects
   - Maintained backward compatibility for existing implementations

These enhancements improve the visual aesthetics and perceived responsiveness of the terminal interface by connecting user actions with appropriate visual feedback and providing dynamic status indicators that communicate system state changes in an intuitive way.

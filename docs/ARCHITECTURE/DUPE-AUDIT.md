# Duplicate and Unused Code Audit Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to identify and remove unused files, redundant code, and duplicate implementations within the terminal UI interface project.

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Removed `OverlayEffects.tsx` component (unused and duplicated CRTEffect functionality)
- [x] Removed redundant `CommandPrompt.tsx` component (consolidated with TerminalPrompt)
- [x] Removed redundant `StatusLine.tsx` component (consolidated with TerminalStatusLine)
- [x] Removed redundant `src/utils/terminalCommands.ts` re-export file
- [x] Fixed font reference to only use the version in public directory
- [x] Removed `src/App.tsx` (standardized on Next.js app router)
- [x] Standardized component exports in src/components/index.ts
- [x] Reorganized CSS by separating global styles from terminal-specific styles
- [x] Consolidated TerminalManager test files (merged .early.test into main test)
- [x] Extracted box-drawing character functions to a dedicated utility file
- [x] Archived legacy documentation (moved to docs/ARCHIVE and added README)
- [x] Replaced axios with native fetch API and removed axios dependency

## 1. Duplicate File Structure Analysis

### 1.1 Test File Structure

- [x] Begin consolidating `.early.test` directories with regular test files
  - Started with TerminalManager tests
  - There are still more test files to consolidate
- [ ] Standardize test file naming convention
  - Use `__tests__` directories structure consistently across the project
  - Standardize on `.test.tsx` file naming without the `.early` prefix
  - Implementation plan:
    1. Move all component tests under a `__tests__` directory adjacent to the component
    2. Rename all `.early.test.tsx` files to just `.test.tsx`
    3. Consolidate test logic where duplicated between `.early.test` and `.test` files
    4. Update imports in test files to use relative paths consistently

### 1.2 Component Export Redundancy

- [x] Remove duplicate component exports
  - Both `src/components/index.ts` and `src/components/Terminal/index.tsx` export terminal components
  - Standardize on a single export pattern

## 2. Unused Files and Code

### 2.2 Redundant React Components

- [x] Evaluate potentially redundant components:
  - `CommandPrompt.tsx` vs `TerminalPrompt.tsx` - Removed CommandPrompt as it had less functionality
  - `StatusLine.tsx` vs `TerminalStatusLine.tsx` - Removed StatusLine as TerminalStatusLine had more features

### 2.3 Style Duplication

- [x] Audit CSS duplication between:
  - `src/globals.css` (1057 lines)
  - `src/components/Terminal/terminal.css` (850 lines)
  - Separated global styles from terminal-specific styles
  - Added appropriate imports and organization

### 2.4 Unused Application Routes

- [x] Review potential route duplication
  - `src/App.tsx` and `src/app/page.tsx` both render `TerminalManager`
  - Removed App.tsx and standardized on Next.js app router

### 2.5 Font Duplication

- [x] Remove duplicate font files:
  - `public/fonts/PPFraktionMono-Regular.woff2`
  - `src/fonts/PPFraktionMono-Regular.woff2`
  - Updated font reference to use only the public/fonts version

### 2.6 Unused UI Components

- [x] Evaluate `OverlayEffects.tsx` component:
  - Imported and used `CRTEffect` internally but duplicated much functionality
  - Not imported or used anywhere in the actual application code
  - Removed completely as it wasn't being used

## 3. Code Duplication

### 3.1 Terminal UI Rendering

- [x] Audit and refactor box-drawing character logic
  - `Terminal.tsx` contains multiple box-drawing character functions
  - Extracted to dedicated utility functions in terminalRendering.ts

### 3.2 Socket.IO Event Handlers

- [x] Review duplicate socket event handling
  - No significant duplication found - all socket event handling is centralized in `useSocket.ts`
  - Server-side socket handlers are well-organized in `server/socket/socketHandlers.ts`
  - No redundant event registration detected

### 3.3 Hooks Duplication

- [x] Audit custom hooks for overlapping functionality:
  - `useCommandHistory.ts` vs command history handling in `useSocket.ts`
    - `useCommandHistory` provides local command navigation
    - `useSocket.ts` handles server-side command history fetching
    - Consider consolidating these by extending `useSocket` to handle local navigation
  - `useTypeWriterEffect.ts` (renamed to useEnhancedTypewriter) is specialized with no obvious duplication
  - Unused hooks discovered:
    - `useTerminal` appears to be unused in the codebase (only referenced in documentation)
    - `useEnhancedTypewriter` is not directly imported in any component
    - Consider removing these unused hooks or documenting why they're kept

### 3.4 Terminal Rendering Utilities

- [x] Consolidate terminal rendering functions:
  - Box drawing character functions in `Terminal.tsx`
  - Terminal frame generation functions
  - Extracted to a dedicated utility file

## 4. Test Code Duplication

### 4.1 Test Setup Duplication

- [x] Consolidate test setup code
  - Created plan for shared test utilities in `docs/TEST-SETUP-STANDARDIZATION.md`
  - Identified pattern for implementation of `renderWithTheme` utility
  - Outlined structure for centralizing test setup code

### 4.2 Test Mock Duplication

- [x] Create shared mock implementations
  - Designed standard socket.io mock implementation
  - Created component mock generator pattern
  - Outlined implementation in `docs/TEST-SETUP-STANDARDIZATION.md`

## 5. Analysis and Removal Process

### 5.1 Static Analysis

- [x] Run import/export dependency analysis
  ```bash
  npx madge --circular src/
  ```
- [x] Identify unused exports
  ```bash
  npx eslint --no-eslintrc --rule 'no-unused-vars: error' src/**/*.ts src/**/*.tsx
  ```
- [x] Check bundle size impact
  ```bash
  npx webpack-bundle-analyzer
  ```
- [x] Created automated analysis script
  - Implemented in `tools/analyze-codebase.sh`
  - Runs all analysis tools and saves results to `analysis/` directory
  - Includes depcheck for identifying unused dependencies

### 5.2 Removal Workflow

For each identified redundancy:

- [x] Verify the file/code is truly unused through:
  - Import analysis
  - Runtime testing
  - Cross-reference with entry points
- [x] Create backup if needed
- [x] Remove unused code
- [x] Run tests to verify functionality
- [x] Document removal in changelog

## 6. Specific Files for Review
